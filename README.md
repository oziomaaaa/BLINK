BLINK 

See what’s been hiding in plain sight. 

📖 What It Does
BLINK is a feature discovery app that helps you unlock the full potential of your favorite applications. It connects you to the apps you already use like Notion, Google Docs, Slack, or miro and reveals the features you’ve never explored. Think of it as a personal tour guide that shows you all the hidden gems and underused features you've been missing in apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and more.
Instead of spending hours watching tutorials or stumbling upon features by accident, BLINK gives you quick, interactive tips and walkthroughs that help you become a power user in minutes. It’s like Spotify Wrapped but for your digital productivity. Blink transforms what you don’t know you have into daily efficiency wins. The core problem isn’t the existence of these features, but poor discoverability and timing. Blink:
- Shows you hidden or underused features in your apps  
- Explains what each feature does and why it’s useful  
- Lets you connect with apps like Notion, Miro, Telegram, and Gmail  
- Keeps everything simple and fun to explore  

💡 Why It Matters
The Problem
Most people use only 30-40% of the features available in their everyday apps. Why? Because:
- Features are hidden in menus and settings
- There are no easy ways to discover what's possible
- Tutorial videos are too long and time-consuming
- Most people don't know what they're missing

The Solution
BLINK bridges the gap between basic usage and power user status by:
- Highlighting underused features based on your usage patterns
- Providing bite-sized, interactive tutorials (under 30 seconds)
- Personalizing recommendations to match your interests
- Making feature discovery fun and rewarding

The Impact
Users will save time, work more efficiently, and feel confident using their favorite apps. Whether it's learning Instagram's collaboration tools, WhatsApp's disappearing messages, or Google Docs' voice typing - BLINK makes sure you never miss out on productivity-boosting features again.
